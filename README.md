# MiniDLNA-RXv2700-alpine
MiniDLNA package for Alpine Linux (apk) patched to work with the Yamahe RX-V2700 receiver 

This is a recompiled version of [MiniDLNA](https://sourceforge.net/projects/minidlna/) packaged for Alpine LINUX with a slight change to the code to allow compatibility with the older Yamaha RX-V2700 receiver (see [here](https://sourceforge.net/p/minidlna/discussion/879957/thread/c5851fd0e5/?limit=25#bf83⁠) for details).
